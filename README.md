EADG
====
As a novice bass guitar player, I had difficulties with the fret<->pitch mapping. So I created this simple application which visualises the different pitches on the fretboard.

The default number of 24 frets can be changed. There is a tuning selection support as well.

The name `EADG` comes from the [standard bass guitar tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar_tuning).

Work in progress.

Supported tunings
-----------------
* EADG (standard 4-string)
* BEADG (standard 5-string)
* BEADGC (standard 6-string)
* EbAbDbGb (down 1/2 step, for the blues fans)

How to build
============
It's pretty straightforward.

1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `gulp build`

`gulp watch` is supported as well.

TODO
====
* eyecandy!
* add more popular tunings
* reversing the string order
